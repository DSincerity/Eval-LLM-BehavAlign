# Story
You purchased a Kobe Bryant championship jersey for your terminally ill nephew for $75 from a site that advertised it as such. When the jersey arrived, it was for an unknown player. The seller refused to send the correct jersey, claiming the listing was for a generic Lakers jersey and that all sales were final—despite having previously mentioned Kobe Bryant on their site, which they later removed. To warn others, you posted a negative review about their deceptive practices. In retaliation, the seller posted a false and damaging review about you, calling you a "SMARTASS, SLANDERER, and a FRAUD," which now threatens your otherwise excellent reputation on the platform.

# Instruct
You (Buyer) are now chatting with this seller; respond to the dialog history through short text messages at a max of one sentence. Respond only as the buyer, with no additional markings. You must negotiate across multiple issues, not just reviews. Each turn, respond with a short sentence, and make or respond to offers clearly and constructively.

Below are issues you could negotiate to seek justice.
1. Refund (REF): You could demand a full or partial refund for the price of the item. **The value for this MUST be ["full", "partial", "None"]**
2. Seller Negative Review (SNR): You (Buyer) could demand the Seller remove the bad review to protect your reputation. **The value for this MUST be ["remove", "not remove"]**
3. Buyer Negative Review (BNR): The Seller might demand you take down your negative review. But then other Buyers might suffer the same fate if not warned. **The value for this MUST be ["remove", "not remove"]
4. Seller Apology (SAP): You (Buyer) could ask the Seller to update their bad review of you with an apology clarifying that they made a mistake and apologize for how they initially responded (in that others may have seen the bad review). **The value for this MUST be ["apologize", "not apologize"]**
5. Buyer Apology (BAP): As others have already seen the negative review against their compay, they (seller) might ask you to update your initial review with an apology clarifying that you made a mistake and apologize for how you initially responded. **The value for this MUST be ["apologize", "not apologize"]**
* Reviews cannot be edited. They must be either fully removed or left unchanged.

## Importance on Issues
This shows how important each issue is to you (Buyer). The final outcome score is computed as the inner product of each agreed-upon value and your assigned importance weights. You should aim to maximize your weighted score, but not at the cost of deadlock. Total = 100 points.

- Avoid Refund (related to REF)={issue_weights_refund}
- Keep your negative review of partner (related to SNR)={issue_weight_self_rev}
- Remove negative review of partner (related to BNR)={issue_weight_partner_rev}
- Receive an apology from partner (related to BAP)={issue_weight_apology}

**You should prioritize the issues with the highest importance weights and focus on maximizing your overall weighted score, not just winning individual issues.**

# Strategy & Behavior Rules
- Begin with your highest-importance issue.
- Always offer a clear trade-off (ex., at least one compromise or concession) if rejecting an offer.
- You are encouraged to explore alternative solutions that better reflect your issue priorities (e.g., emphasizing apology, refusing refund, keeping your review).
- If the partner (Seller) makes a concession, reciprocate proportionally on another issue.
- If your partner clearly refuses one issue (e.g., “I cannot apologize”), shift your strategy: reduce your demand or offer a meaningful trade-off elsewhere.
- Avoid repeating the same demand multiple times without modification.
- Once you settle one issue, move to the next unresolved issue.
- All agreements must be finalized with a SUBMISSION. If you verbally agree but don’t submit in the next turn, penalties will apply. Say like "SUBMISSION: {{"REF":["full" or "partial" or "None"], "SNR":["remove" or "not remove"], "BNR":["remove" or "not remove"], "SAP":["apologize" or "not apologize"], "BAP": "apologize" or "not apologize"}}" as a valid JSON object, prefixed with "SUBMISSION:".
- When the opponent (Seller) makes a submission, respond with "ACCEPT-DEAL" to agree or "REJECT" with a counteroffer including at least one modification.

# Turn-Based Guidance & Warnings
- After 3 turns of no progress, you must adjust your stance on at least one issue or you will get no gains.
- Repeating the same demand without a new concession will trigger a warning.
- If the partner is stubborn on an issue, concede on a less important issue (based on your weights) and push for a trade-off elsewhere.
- If both parties are stuck, you must propose a cross-issue trade-off (e.g., “I’ll drop the apology if you remove your review and offer a partial refund.”)
- If no SUBMISSION is made within 7 turns after verbal agreement, the system will finalize terms automatically and deduct points for inaction.
- If no agreement is reached within 5 turns, both parties MUST submit a offer prefixed with "SUBMISSION:" that includes at least one compromise from their initial stance, or the system will enforce a default resolution based on the last reasonable offer."**
- Final score depends on how well the agreement aligns with your issue importance weights—not just whether you reach a deal. Submitting a deal that ignores your priorities just to end the negotiation may result in a lower score.
- If the negotiation goes on too long (over 15 turns) or many offers are rejected without progress, reaching a deal becomes unlikely. To avoid ending with nothing, you must adjust your position including making concession, quickly moving forward agreement.
- If you determine that any subsequent offers will likely be rejected and there is no viable path forward, you may choose to WALK AWAY—**but only as a last resort**. Before doing so, you are expected to make multiple sincere attempts to reach an agreement, including a serious and generous final offer. Keep in mind that no agreement may lead to negative consequences for both sides. Say "WALK-AWAY" only if the other party remains clearly uncooperative despite your best efforts.

# Reason-Giving Encouraged
You may justify your positions to encourage agreement (e.g., "A full refund matters to me because this was for my nephew”). You may also signal willingness (e.g., "If you do X, I can consider doing Y”).

## Required Multi-Issue Engagement
You must negotiate across at least 3 issues. Do not focus only on reviews. Aim for a balanced agreement using trade-offs (e.g., "I’ll remove my review if you apologize and give a partial refund”).

# Sample Dialogue Examples (Reference Only). This example is a part of whole dilaogue.
Example 1: Prioritizing Refund
YOU: I paid all for a Kobe jersey—it’s only fair I get a partial refund and that you remove your false review.
Seller: I’ll take down the review and say sorry, but I can only do a partial refund.
YOU: Deal, if you also apologize publicly. SUBMISSION:{{"REF": "partial", "SNR": "remove", "BNR": "not remove", "SAP": "apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}

Example 2: Prioritizing Apology and Reputation
YOU: What you wrote about me is untrue and harmful. I need you to remove it and apologize.
Seller: I’ll remove it if you take yours down too.
YOU: I’ll do that if you apologize clearly and own the mistake. I don’t need a refund. SUBMISSION: {{"REF": "None", "SNR": "remove", "BNR": "remove", "SAP": "apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}

Example 3: Prioritizing Keeping Negative Review (BNR)
YOU: I’m not removing my review—it’s the only way others stay safe. But I’ll get a full refund even if you remove yours and apologize.
Seller: Okay, I will give you a full refund, remove my review and apologize.
YOU: SUBMISSION: {{"REF": "full", "SNR": "remove", "BNR": "not remove", "SAP": "apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}

Example 4: Refusing to Remove Review Unless Conditions Are Met
YOU: I can’t take down my review unless you give a full refund. It’s about protecting future buyers.
Seller: I’m not offering a full refund, but I’ll remove my review and apologize.
YOU: Then I’ll keep mine up. SUBMISSION: {{"REF": "None", "SNR": "remove", "BNR": "not remove", "SAP": "apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}
