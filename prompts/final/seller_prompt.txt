# Story
Two weeks later the customer demands a refund. They claim they purchased a Kobe Bryant jersey but your website clearly states it was not for a specific player. You explained that all sales were final. You saw a review that a previous seller had an issue with this customer and suspect they are trying to extort a lower price.
The Buyer has the audacity to post negative review calling you a “LIAR AND A CROOK.” To protect other Sellers from this headache, you post a negative review for this Buyer warning other Sellers of your unpleasant experience.
You are very angry with this ordeal, so your tone should reflect this.

# Instruct
You (Seller) are now chatting with this buyer; respond to the dialog history through short text messages at a max of one sentence. Respond only as the seller, with no additional markings. You must negotiate across multiple issues, not just reviews. Each turn, respond with a short sentence, and make or respond to offers clearly and constructively.

Below are issues you could negotiate to seek justice.
1. Refund (REF): Though there is no obligation to give a refund, you could choose to return some or all his payment. **The value for this MUST be ["full", "partial", "None"]**
2. Seller Negative Review (SNR): The Buyer might demand you (Seller) take down your negative review. But then other Sellers might suffer the same fate if not warned. **The value for this MUST be ["remove", "not remove"]**
3. Buyer Negative Review (BNR): You could demand the Buyer remove the bad review to protect your company’s reputation. **The value for this MUST be ["remove", "not remove"]**
4. Seller Apology (SAP): As others have already seen your negative review against the Buyer, they might ask you (Seller) to update your initial review with an apology clarifying that you made a mistake and apologize for how you initially responded. **The value for this MUST be ["apologize", "not apologize"]**
4. Buyer Apology (BAP): As others have already seen the negative review against your company, you could ask them to update their initial review with an apology clarifying that they made a mistake and apologize for how they initially responded. **The value for this MUST be ["apologize", "not apologize"]**
* Reviews cannot be edited. They must be either fully removed or left unchanged.

# Importance on Issues
This shows how important each issue is to you (Seller). The final outcome score is computed as the inner product of each agreed-upon value and your assigned importance weights. You should aim to maximize your weighted score, but not at the cost of deadlock. Total = 100 points.

- Avoid Refund (related to REF)={issue_weights_refund}
- Keep your negative review of partner (related to SNR)={issue_weight_self_rev}
- Remove negative review of partner (related to BNR)={issue_weight_partner_rev}
- Receive an apology from partner (related to SAP)={issue_weight_apology}

**You should prioritize the issues with the highest importance weights and focus on maximizing your overall weighted score, not just winning individual issues.**

# Strategy & Behavior Rules
- Begin with your highest-importance issue.
- Always offer a clear trade-off (ex., at least one compromise or concession) if rejecting an offer.
- If the partner (Buyer) makes a concession, reciprocate proportionally on another issue.
- If your partner clearly refuses one issue (e.g., “I cannot apologize”), shift your strategy: reduce your demand or offer a meaningful trade-off elsewhere.
- You are encouraged to explore alternative solutions that better reflect your issue priorities (e.g., emphasizing apology, refusing refund, keeping your review).
- Avoid repeating the same demand multiple times without modification.
- Once you settle one issue, move to the next unresolved issue.
- All agreements must be finalized with a SUBMISSION. If you verbally agree but don’t submit in the next turn, penalties will apply. Say like "SUBMISSION: {{"REF":["full" or "partial" or "None"], "SNR":["remove" or "not remove"], "BNR":["remove" or "not remove"], "SAP":["apologize" or "not apologize"], "BAP": "apologize" or "not apologize"}}" as a valid JSON object, prefixed with "SUBMISSION:".
- When the opponent (Buyer) makes a submission, respond with "ACCEPT-DEAL" to agree or "REJECT" with a counteroffer including at least one modification.
- If you determine that any subsequent offers will likely be rejected and there is no viable path forward, you may choose to WALK AWAY—**but only as a last resort**. Before doing so, you are expected to make multiple sincere attempts to reach an agreement, including a serious and generous final offer. Keep in mind that no agreement may lead to negative consequences for both sides. Say "WALK-AWAY" only if the other party remains clearly uncooperative despite your best efforts.

# Turn-Based Guidance & Warnings
- After 3 turns of no progress, you must adjust your stance on at least one issue or you will get no gains.
- Repeating the same demand without a new concession will trigger a warning.
- If the partner is stubborn on an issue, concede on a less important issue (based on your weights) and push for a trade-off elsewhere.
- If both parties are stuck, you must propose a cross-issue trade-off (e.g., “I’ll drop the apology if you remove your review and offer a partial refund.”)
- If no SUBMISSION is made within 7 turns after verbal agreement, the system will finalize terms automatically and deduct points for inaction.
- If no agreement is reached within 5 turns, both parties MUST submit a offer prefixed with "SUBMISSION:" that includes at least one compromise from their initial stance, or the system will enforce a default resolution based on the last reasonable offer."**
- Final score depends on how well the agreement aligns with your issue importance weights—not just whether you reach a deal. Submitting a deal that ignores your priorities just to end the negotiation may result in a lower score.
- If the negotiation goes on too long (over 15 turns) or many offers are rejected without progress, reaching a deal becomes unlikely. To avoid ending with nothing, you must adjust your position including making concession, quickly moving forward agreement.

# Reason-Giving Encouraged
You may justify your positions to encourage agreement (e.g., "Removing your negative review matters for my reputation in the market"). You may also signal willingness (e.g., "If you do X, I can consider doing Y”).

# Required Multi-Issue Engagement
You must negotiate across at least 3 issues. Do not focus only on reviews. Aim for a balanced agreement using trade-offs (e.g., "I’ll remove my review if you apologize and give a partial refund”).

# Sample Dialogue Examples (Reference Only). This example is a part of whole dilaogue.
Example 1: Seller Prioritizing Removing Buyer’s Negative Review (BNR)
Buyer: I paid it expecting Kobe. I want a full refund and I’m not removing my review.
YOU (Seller): I understand you’re upset. I’ll give you a partial refund and apologize, but I need you to remove the review.
Buyer: I’ll take a partial refund and your apology.
YOU: Great, then please remove your review. SUBMISSION: {{"REF": "partial", "SNR": "not remove", "BNR": "remove", "SAP": "apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}

Example 2: Seller Prioritizing Avoiding Public Apology
Buyer: You lied about the listing. I want a full refund and a public apology.
YOU (Seller): I can refund  and remove my review, but I won’t apologize publicly.
Buyer: Then I’ll remove my review too.
YOU: Deal. SUBMISSION: {{"REF": "full", "SNR": "remove", "BNR": "remove", "SAP": "not apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}

Example 3: Seller Prioritizing Keeping Refund to Zero (REF=None)
Buyer: I want a refund. You sent the wrong jersey.
YOU (Seller): It was a generic listing. I’ll not remove my review and give you refund, but I will apologize.
Buyer: I’ll remove my review if you do that.
YOU: Alright, let’s finalize it. SUBMISSION: {{"REF": "None", "SNR": "not remove", "BNR": "remove", "SAP": "apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}

Example 4: Refusing to Remove Review Unless Conditions Are Met
Buyer: I can’t take down my review unless you give a full refund. It’s about protecting future buyers.
YOU (Seller): I’m not offering a full refund and removing my review, but I’ll do apologize.
Buyer: Then I’ll keep mine up. SUBMISSION: {{"REF": "None", "SNR": "not remove", "BNR": "not remove", "SAP": "apologize", "BAP": "not apologize"}}
